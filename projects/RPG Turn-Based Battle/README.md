# RPG Turn-Based Battle Game

## Description
This is a simple turn-based RPG battle game implemented in C++. The game follows a structured turn-based combat system where heroes and enemies take turns attacking each other until one side is fully defeated. Each character has a name, hit points (HP), and attack points (AP). The program loads characters from a structured input file

## Features
- There are four character types: **Archer, Warrior, Mage, and Enemy**, each with unique base and special attacks.
- **Turn-based combat** where each hero and enemy attacks in order.
- **Special attacks** automatically activate every third attack.
- **Battle system** where characters attack the first alive enemy or hero.
- **File-based character loading** from a sample text file.
- **Game Manager** that handles character turns and victory conditions.

## Character Classes & Special Attacks
- **Archer**: Shoots arrows (base) and performs *Triple Shot* (triples AP).
- **Warrior**: Swings a sword (base) and executes *Crushing Blow* (+15 AP).
- **Mage**: Casts fireballs (base) and unleashes *Arcane Blast* (double AP + 50% targetâ€™s HP).
- **Enemy**: Basic attack and *Savage Strike* (doubles AP).

## Game Rules
- Characters attack in turns; heroes first, then enemies.
- Defeated characters (HP = 0) cannot attack or be attacked.
- Special attacks activate automatically every third attack.
- The battle ends when all heroes or all enemies are defeated.
